# QuickLook

~~Keep track of all my QuickLook plugins.~~

**Note:** I personally no longer use this repository since many of these QuickLook plugins can now be installed via [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/).

## Installation

Just checkout the project in the location that makes the most sense for your machine.

If you want the plugins to only work for your user:

```
$ cd ~/Library
$ git clone git://github.com/delynn/QuickLook.git
```

If you want the plugins to be available to all users:
```
$ cd /Library
$ git clone git://github.com/delynn/QuickLook.git
```
