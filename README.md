# QuickLook

Keep track of all my QuickLook plugins.

## Installation

Just checkout the project in the location that makes the most sense for your machine.

1. If you want the plugins to only work for your user:

```
    $ cd ~/Library
    $ git clone git://github.com/delynn/QuickLook.git
```

2. If you want the plugins to be available to all users:

```
    $ cd /Library
    $ git clone git://github.com/delynn/QuickLook.git
```
